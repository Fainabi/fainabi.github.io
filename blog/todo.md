# Hello from `fainabi.github.io`

When you gaze into the blogs, they become shy.

## Ongoing

## Journals

### Development Journals

- 2023.3.14: build basic directory-to-blog structure
- 2023.3.16: minimal theme and icon set
- 2025.4.30: add mathjax rendering equations
- 2026.2.10: powered by AI to migrate the project to next.js
- 2026.2.12: add plot-chart for visualization

### Issues

- Elm markdown libraries are not very good for equations. A better solution is still to render the markdown to HTML first then load them.
