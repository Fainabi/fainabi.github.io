# Getting Started with Elm

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on getting started with Elm! In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of Elm and build our first application.

## What is Elm?

Elm is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It's known for:
- Zero runtime errors
- Excellent performance
- Great developer experience
- Strong type system

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, install Elm using npm:
```bash
npm install -g elm
```

Create a new project:
```bash
mkdir my-elm-app
cd my-elm-app
elm init
```

## Your First Elm Application

Here's a simple counter application:

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Browser
import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)

-- MODEL
type alias Model = Int

init : Model
init = 0

-- UPDATE
type Msg = Increment | Decrement

update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment ->
            model + 1
        
        Decrement ->
            model - 1

-- VIEW
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
        , div [] [ text (String.fromInt model) ]
        , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
        ]

-- MAIN
main =
    Browser.sandbox
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        }
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first Elm application running, you can:
1. Explore the Elm Architecture
2. Learn about Types and Type Annotations
3. Work with Commands and Subscriptions
4. Build more complex applications
