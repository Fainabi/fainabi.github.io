# Tracks of Immersion and Flow

The articles and notes of papers track my views during a immersive learning and flows. Flow is a state of concentration on doing, which is explored by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow). In order to re-gain the past flow of learning, I made this blog.

I believe that we in the future, and in the past, are distinct. Therefore, for providing possibly necessary information and quick recall of the ah-huh moments, I tried to write the pivotal materials in lean words. I also have it in the mind that the readers of the articles may not experience the same learning procedures, which may make them confused about some contents (e.g. some commutative diagrams, why I place the comments, details of property and proving, etc.). Even knowing this, I would prefer to make the blogs as lean as possible, also with some connectivity among the articles. Not to hide anything, but I want to try a bird's eye view as an entry point for immersive learning and the flow. Rough, but directioning.

For an example of tasting the style of the blogs, I end my words by the following summary:

<div align="center" style="font-style: italic;">
It's a trial to solve the puzzles from the forgetful functor.
</div>

:::remark remark
The forgetful functor discards some relations and compresses the entities of a category. I borrow it for the relation between the past us and future us.
