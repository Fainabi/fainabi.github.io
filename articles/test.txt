PUBLIC OPINION



BY



WALTER LIPPMANN





TO

FAYE LIPPMANN



Wading River,

Long Island.

1921.



_"Behold! human beings living in a sort of underground den,

which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all across

the den; they have been here from their childhood, and have their

legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only

see before them; for the chains are arranged in such a manner as

to prevent them from turning round their heads. At a distance

above and behind them the light of a fire is blazing, and between

the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will

see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen

which marionette players have before them, over which they show

the puppets.



I see, he said.



And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying

vessels, which appear over the wall; also figures of men and

animals, made of wood and stone and various materials; and some

of the prisoners, as you would expect, are talking, and some of

them are silent?



This is a strange image, he said, and they are strange prisoners.



Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows,

or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the

opposite wall of the cave?



True, he said: how could they see anything but the shadows if

they were never allowed to move their heads?



And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they

would see only the shadows?



Yes, he said.



And if they were able to talk with one another, would they not

suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?"_

--The Republic of Plato, Book Seven. (Jowett Translation.)
